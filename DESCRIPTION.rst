tinynumpy:

A lightweight, pure Python, numpy compliant ndarray class.

This module is intended to allow libraries that depend on numpy, but do not make much use of array processing, to make numpy an optional dependency. This might make such libaries better available, also on platforms like Pypy and Jython
